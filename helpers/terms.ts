statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any
award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable

Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non

Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.
In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more
than one (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable,
then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be

illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the
courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
Restrictions
The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To
the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no
right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action
procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration
The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal
negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the
validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from,
allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If
this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute
falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be
decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties
agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
